# 🚀 AI Training – 2-Week Intensive Program

Welcome to my AI training repository!  
This is where I document my intensive, fast-paced self-learning journey in Python and agentic AI, over a 2-week plan.

## 📚 Goals

- Build solid foundations in Python for data & AI
- Understand the principles of agentic AI (AutoGPT, CrewAI, etc.)
- Build a simple AI agent in Python
- Showcase my learning progress in an open and structured portfolio
